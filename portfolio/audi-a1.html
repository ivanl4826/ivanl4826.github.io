	<h2>Metroproject quattro (2007)</h2>
	<p>The A1 was previewed at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show in the form of the Audi metroproject quattro concept car.The concept seats four and features a new plug-in hybrid powertrain. With this powertrain, a 1.4 L (85.4 cu in) 148 bhp (110.4 kW) Turbo FSI engine drives the front wheels via a six-speed S-Tronic, while a 40 bhp (29.8 kW; 40.6 PS) electric motor provides power to the rear wheels. The electric motor is also capable of producing 148 lb⋅ft (201 N⋅m) of torque.
     The metroproject quattro is able to travel 62 miles (100 km) at up to 62 mph (100 km/h) on one charge of its lithium-ion batteries, which reduces fuel consumption by up to 15%. Both power sources are available to use simultaneously, with the driver then benefiting from MacPherson strut front and rear four-link suspension configuration, electromechanical speed-sensitive power steering with a low energy draw, Audi magnetic ride adaptive damping technology, and 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.8 seconds.
